1. Rewrite the TimePoint class.
   Current one using chrono is complex and may not portable.

2. Try to use unique_ptr instead of raw pointer in TimerQueue::Entry.
   Current work meets some problem in using unique_ptr correctly.

3. Write a thread library to substitute std::thread.

4. Write a log library to substitute std::cout.

5. Use epoll in Poller under Linux.
